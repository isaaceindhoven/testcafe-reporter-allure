# @isaac.frontend/testcafe-reporter-allure

An [Allure](https://allure.qatools.ru/) reporter plugin for [TestCaf√©](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/).

The inspiration for this project was its namesake, [testcafe-reporter-allure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/testcafe-reporter-allure), made by azohra-core, making use of the 2.0.0 version of the [allure-js-commons](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-js/tree/main/packages/allure-js-commons) package.
